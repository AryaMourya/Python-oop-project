# 🐍 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python  

## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains my projects and exercises based on the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
Each sub-project demonstrates one or more OOP principles — such as **Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.  

This repo marks my transition from basic Python programming to writing structured, modular, and scalable code.
